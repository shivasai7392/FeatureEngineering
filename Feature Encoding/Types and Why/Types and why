Types of feature engineering Encoding Techniques

1.Nominal Encoding

2.Ordinal Encoding

for example there is a datset of students with their grades and Gender


grades     Gender

A           male

B           female

c           male

D           male

E           female

F           male

grades is encoded using ordinal encoding
Gender is encoded usinf nominal encoding


Types of Nominal Encoding

1.One hot encoding

2.One hot encoding with many many categories

3.Mean encoding





Types of Ordinal Encoding

1.label encoding

2.Target guided ordinal encoding




One Hot encoding

Country

India

Aus

WestIndies

            after encoding
            
               India          Aus       WestIndies
                   1            0          0
                   0            1          0
                   0            0          1
Disadvantages

1.Curse of Dimensionalities


label encoding

grades

A

B

C

D

E

F

    After encoding
    
    A   B   C  D  E  F
    1   2   3  4  5  6
    
    grades
    
    1
    
    2
    
    3
    
    4
    
    5
    
    6
    
One hot encoding with multiple categories

for a feature of 50 nominal categories

top 10 most occuring columns are converted into One hot encoding

so we will create 10 -1(dummy) columns but not 49


target guided ordinal encoding

f1   O/p

A    0

B    0

B    1

A    0


we calculate the mean of the target for feature A and B and thus

A - mean is 0

B - mean is 1

so B is given the highest rank


f1    O/p

0     0

1     0

1     1

0     0


Mean Encoding


replacing the category with mean value 



Why feature Scaling
___________________

scaling down the features between 0 and 1 or any range 


this might be usefule when using 
algorithms like 

1.Linear regression(for gradient descent finding the global minima)


2.k means clustering

3.k neighbours classifier
  
  2 and 3 perform on Eucledian distance
 
4.Deep learning algorithms


When we should not do 
feature scaling
for algorithms like

1.Decission tree

2.Random forest

3.xgboost
