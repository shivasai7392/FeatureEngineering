if there are more no of categories for a label then with the help of one hot encoding we can create columns with value 0 or 1 but
it may result in curse of dimensionality

in those cases we can take top 10 most occuring categories for our one hot encoding

advantages

1.Straightforward to implement
2.does not require hrs of data exploration
3.does not expand massively the feature space

disadvantages

1.does not add any information that may make the variable more predictive
2.does not keep the information of the ignored variables
